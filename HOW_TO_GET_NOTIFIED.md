# 🔔 Get Notified When Build Completes

## 📧 Automatic Notifications

### GitHub Email Notifications (Recommended)

GitHub will email you when the build completes!

**Turn it on:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Droze-svj/MOTTO-VISON/settings/notifications
2. OR: https://github.com/settings/notifications
3. Under "Actions":
   - ✅ Enable "Send notifications for failed workflows only"
   - OR ✅ Enable "Send notifications for all workflow runs"

**You'll get email when:**
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ❌ Build fails

---

### Firebase Notifications

You'll also get notified when the app is uploaded:
- Firebase sends email when new build is available
- If you're in the "beta-testers" group

---

## 🔍 Manual Check (Fastest)

**Check build status:**
https://github.com/Droze-svj/MOTTO-VISON/actions

**Look for:**
- ✅ Green checkmark = Success! Ready to test!
- ❌ Red X = Failed (let me know, I'll help debug)
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Still running

---

## ⏰ When to Check Back:

**Build started:** Just now
**Estimated completion:** ~10-15 minutes from now

**Check again in:** 
- 10 minutes (probably still running)
- 15 minutes (should be done)
- 20 minutes (definitely done or failed)

---

## 🎯 What to Do When Complete:

### ✅ If Build Succeeds:

1. **Come back and tell me:** "The build completed!"
2. **I'll help you:**
   - Download the IPA from Firebase
   - Install on your iPhone
   - Start testing
   - Invite other testers

### ❌ If Build Fails:

1. **Come back and tell me:** "The build failed"
2. **Share the error message** (copy from Actions page)
3. **I'll help you fix it!**
