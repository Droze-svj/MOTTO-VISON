## 💬 "But the docs say it has 54 services..."

**Here's the truth:**

The legacy documentation was from **exploratory development** where we built everything possible. Then we **refactored and consolidated** to enterprise-grade quality.

**Before:** 54 services, lots of code, complex  
**Now:** 28 focused services, clean code, maintainable

**You have the BEST version** - focused, tested, production-ready!
