## 🔄 Your Daily Workflow (Simple!)

### **Step 1: Make Changes**

```bash

### **Step 3: GitHub Actions Does Everything!** ✨

**Automatically:**

- ✅ Installs all dependencies
- ✅ Runs CocoaPods (no iCloud issues!)
- ✅ Builds iOS app
- ✅ Reports success or errors

**Time:** ~5-8 minutes

### **Step 4: Check Results**

**Go to:** https://github.com/Droze-svj/MOTTO-VISON/actions

**Look for:**
- ✅ Green checkmark = Build successful! Your code works!
