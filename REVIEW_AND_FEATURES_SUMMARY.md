## 💡 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Student Learning**
```typescript
// Student asks complex question
const emotions = await EmotionTrackingService.analyzeEmotion(question, userId);
// Detects: confusion (intensity: 7)

const level = await AdaptiveDifficultyService.getDifficultyLevel(userId, 'Math');
// Returns: 'beginner'

const plan = await MultiTurnPlanningService.createPlan(userId, question);
// Creates 6-step learning plan

// Response adapts to beginner level + provides emotional support
```

### **Example 2: Project Management**
```typescript
// User manages multiple projects
const branch1 = await ConversationBranchingService.createBranch(userId, 'Project A');
const branch2 = await ConversationBranchingService.createBranch(userId, 'Project B');

// Work on Project A
// Switch to Project B when urgent issue comes up
const detection = InterruptionHandlerService.detectInterruption(...);
// Saves Project A context, switches gracefully

// Multi-turn plan tracks both projects separately
```

### **Example 3: Long Conversation**
```typescript
// After 50 messages
const compressed = await ContextCompressionService.compressConversation(messages);
// Saves 65% tokens

const insights = await ConversationAnalyticsService.getInsights(userId);
// Shows: "Top 3 topics: JavaScript, React, TypeScript"
// "You're improving! 85% comprehension rate"

const knowledge = KnowledgeGraphService.getInsights(userId);
// Shows learning path from JavaScript → React
```
