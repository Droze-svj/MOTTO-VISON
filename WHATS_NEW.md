- Knowledge gaps

### **Example:**
```
Your Knowledge Graph:

JavaScript (Level 85) ──→ React (Level 70)
    ↓                          ↓
  ES6 (Level 80)          Hooks (Level 60)
    ↓                          ↓
Async/Await (Level 75)   Context (Level 55)

```

### **Impact:**

```
50 messages = ~10,000 tokens
      ↓ Compression ↓

```

- Lower costs
- Better performance

---

## 🎯 **7. Multi-Turn Planning**

### **What's New:**

✅ Step 2: Install dependencies (Done)
🔄 Step 3: Create auth components (In Progress)
⏳ Step 4: Add login logic (Pending)
⏳ Step 5: Test & deploy (Pending)

Progress: 50% complete
```

### **Shown In Header:**
```
🎯 React app with auth (50%)
```

---

## 📈 **8. Adaptive Difficulty**

### **What's New:**
Responses **automatically adjust** to match your expertise level!

### **4 Levels:**
- 🟢 **Beginner:** Simple words, many examples, analogies
- 🟡 **Intermediate:** Standard complexity, balanced
- 🟠 **Advanced:** Technical depth, fewer examples
- 🔴 **Expert:** Maximum complexity, concise

### **Example:**

**Beginner Level:**
```
"Think of React hooks like a toolbox. Each hook is 
a different tool for a specific job. useState is 
like a notepad - it lets you write down and remember 
things. Here are 3 examples..."
```

**Expert Level:**
```
"React hooks leverage closures to maintain state 
across render cycles. useState returns a tuple 
with current state and updater function utilizing 
the reconciliation algorithm."
```

### **Impact:**
- Perfect learning pace
- Not too simple, not too complex
- Grows with you

---

## 🌳 **9. Conversation Branching**

    ├─ Branch 2: React Hooks
    │    ├─ useState examples
    │    └─ useEffect patterns
    └─ Branch 3: Styling Options
         └─ CSS-in-JS comparison
```

### **How to Use:**
1. Start main conversation
2. Ask tangent question → New branch created
3. Explore freely
4. Switch back to main topic anytime

---

## ⏸️ **10. Smart Interruption Handling**

### **What's New:**
Change topics mid-conversation? **No problem!** MOTTO gracefully handles it.

### **Example:**
```
You: "Explain React hooks"
MOTTO: "React hooks are..."

You: "Actually, what's for lunch?"

MOTTO: "Got it! Let's shift gears to lunch ideas. 🍽️

Here are some options...

(We can come back to React hooks whenever you'd like.)"
